#usage: bash Me-phresistance ref seq combo files for Hsp90 and McrA genes. Lets us id matches in experimental proteomes
# Identifying methanogens by isolating the methyl-coenzyme M reductase
#(McrA) gene, which catalyzes the last step of methanogenesis and is
# highly conserved across all methanogens.
# Also identifying pH resistance by isolating the number of copies of the HSP70
# gene, which is involved in protein biogenesis and refolding for stress
# resistance.
